# stride-pathfinding-demo
A demo of pathfinding for 10,000 entities with instanced models!

Disclaimer: My hardware is fairly high end, I have not tested everywhere! If you are having issues please lower the spawn count by changing the below settings.

This demo is a demonstration of using (kind of) data oriented design and model instancing to try and get as much performance in a single thread. No LOD or distance based optimizations have been made!
